The project was built to ensure a sustainable energy distribution across the European Union, especially as gas prices reached record highs in Europe \u2013 which gets more than a third of its natural gas from Russia.</p>, <p>As the conflict continues in Ukraine, European gas prices have soared and there is the likelihood that Moscow could shut off supplies of gas, widely considered part of Putin\u2019s leverage against the West in his obsession with Ukraine.</p>, <p>Before that, European countries will be pulling the stops to find contingency supply networks in the coming weeks. In fact, sources say the United States is already in talks with Qatar over supplying gas to the EU as a crucial substitute for Russia.</p>, <p>However, during a <a href=\"/news/2022/2/22/what-was-said-at-gas-exporting-countries-forum\">forum of gas exporting countries</a> held last week in Qatar, the bloc said it would be unable to provide a considerable amount of replacement gas to Europe in the event of sanctions against Russia. They stressed the need for significant investment in gas infrastructure, as well as long-term contracts, to guarantee a large supply to Europe.</p>, <p>This has led to an emerging debate about whether African countries, which have some of the world\u2019s deepest gas reserves, can step in to fill the gap \u2013 a demand of 150-190 billion cubic metres annually that Russia has usually supplied to Europe.</p>, <p>Recently,\u00a0Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan <a href=\"https://www.theafricareport.com/178985/tanzania-president-samia-says-russia-ukraine-tension-an-opportunity-for-gas-sales/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the Russian invasion of Ukraine could prove to be an opportunity for gas sales as the East African country makes efforts to secure a new energy market outside Africa. \u201cWhether Africa or Europe or America, we are looking for markets,\u201d said Hassan. \u201cAnd fortunately, we are working with companies from Europe.\u201d</p>, <p>Tanzania, which has the sixth-largest gas reserves in Africa \u2013 an estimated 57 trillion cubic feet (1.6 billion cubic metres) of gas reserves \u2013 says it has been working with Shell to utilise its vast offshore gas resources and export to Europe and elsewhere.</p>, <p>Africa\u2019s largest gas producer has similar plans too. Timipre Sylva, Nigeria\u2019s junior petroleum minister, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-02-23/nigeria-petroleum-minister-no-time-to-be-bullish-on-oil-video?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=africa&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-africa\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> the press at the gas exporting countries\u2019 forum in Doha, \u201cWe want to build a pipeline, a trans-Sahara pipeline, that is going to take our gas to Algeria, then to Europe.\u201d</p>, <p>Nigeria\u2019s comments are buoyed by the recent signing of an MoU with Algeria and the Niger Republic and the ongoing construction of the Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline, a 614km (381.5 miles) long natural gas pipeline beginning in northern Nigeria.</p>, <p>There is no official word on when the pipeline, first mooted in the 1970s, will be completed but it is slated to run through northern Nigeria into Niger and Algeria, connecting to Europe eventually.</p>, <p>Still there are concerns about whether African countries can become a proper stopgap solution for natural gas as Europe tackles Russia\u2019s military onslaught against one of its own \u2013 or long-term suppliers.</p>, <p>Experts say a historic lack of investment in gas infrastructure has hampered the energy industry in sub-Saharan Africa, unlike in Northern Africa.</p>, <p>For instance, the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline in Algeria \u2013 Africa\u2019s largest natural gas exporter \u2013 conveys natural gas through Morocco to Spain and Portugal, and the Medgaz pipeline links Algeria directly to Spain.</p>, <p>Experts <a href=\"https://www.theafricareport.com/125484/what-impact-will-the-maghreb-europe-gas-pipeline-have-on-morocco/\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> that Algeria exported 9 billion cubic feet (255 million cubic metres) of gas to Spain in 2020 and up to 17 billion cubic feet (481 million cubic metres) annually before that. The drop was due to gas production dipping in a breakdown in relations with Morocco; last October, Algeria announced that it would immediately begin exporting gas directly to Spain.</p>, <p>\u201cIt is important to note that [North] Africa already has an established gas export market with Europe [before the Ukrainian crisis],\u201d said Linda Mabhena-Olagunju, oil and gas lawyer and CEO of Johannesburg-based independent power producer DLO Energy Resource Group. \u201cThe Medgaz pipeline capacity enhancements [in Algeria] are also expected to increase exports to Europe.\u201d</p>, <p>But many African countries with massive gas reserves have also struggled to attract investment to build gas infrastructure projects to supply the European market.</p>, <p>Angola, which has 13.5 trillion cubic feet (382 billion cubic metres) of proven gas reserves, has experienced a sharp decline in oil and gas production in the last five years due to a combination of technical and operational problems, as well as a lack of upstream investment and incentives.</p>, <p>In 2020, the Muhammadu Buhari administration announced \u201cThe Decade of Gas\u201d, a Nigerian initiative to prioritise the gas industry and take advantage of a global transition to cleaner fuels.</p>, <p>As part of that drive, it has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHVPSiz4x54\" target=\"_blank\">commenced</a> construction of the 614km-long, $2.5bn Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Natural Gas Pipeline. Most of the funding comes as a loan from Chinese banks.</p>, <p>Still, like in many other African countries, significant investments are needed to build trans-regional and intercontinental pipelines, in order to open up access to Europe. And they all need loads of capital.</p>, <p>Nigeria is hoping that its new industry legislation \u2013 signed last August \u2013 can provide a new framework to cut down on waste and corruption in the oil sector, reshape host community relations and ultimately, investment.</p>, <p>\u201cNigeria is not presently a top investment destination for the oil and gas industry,\u201d said Joe Nwakwue, former chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers in Nigeria and ex-adviser to the junior petroleum minister. \u201cThis was why we pushed for a competitive fiscal arrangement in the bill.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAdditionally, to address the infrastructure challenge, we need to open up the sector to private capital,\u201d he said. \u201cOur current oligopoly would not suffice as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation lacks the capital to build our required infrastructure.\u201d</p>, <p>Using vessels for direct transport of liquefied natural gas across the seas could also put sub-Saharan African countries in prime position to become competitive producers and exporters, Mabhena-Olagunju told Al Jazeera.</p>, <p>There are also other existential issues that experts say African countries have to fix first to be a ready alternative for Europe in situations of urgency.</p>, <p>Mozambique holds roughly 100 trillion cubic feet (2.8 trillion cubic metres) of proven natural gas reserves, accounting for approximately 1 percent of the world\u2019s total reserves.
